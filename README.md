## ABOUT ME

👋 Hey there! I'm Joshua Benavides, a web developer hailing from Colombia 🇨🇴. With a passion for crafting immersive web experiences and thrilling games, I bring a diverse skill set to the table.

👨‍💻 As a seasoned web developer, I'm fluent in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Bootstrap. I specialize in creating sleek and responsive websites that captivate users and drive engagement.

🕹️ When I'm not coding for the web, I'm delving into the exciting world of game development. With expertise in C# and Unity, I bring virtual worlds to life, creating experiences that spark joy and wonder.

📚 Currently, I'm expanding my horizons by diving into GoLang, exploring its potential to streamline development and enhance performance.

🎓 I graduated with a degree in Multimedia Production from FADP, honing my skills in design, animation, and multimedia storytelling. To further refine my craft, I'm currently enrolled in a web development and e-commerce diploma program, where I'm mastering both front-end and back-end technologies like Laravel and Composer.

🌟 At 22 years old, I'm driven by a relentless thirst for knowledge and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm.

🚀 Let's connect and collaborate on projects that push the envelope and inspire innovation!
